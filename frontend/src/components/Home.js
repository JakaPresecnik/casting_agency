                    This is just a simple sample frontend. Because I have NO IDEA or any motivation
                    to know anything about what goes on in this types of jobs 
                    (casting agencies), the frontend is looking the way it does. 
                    But I got it made anyways.

                    Main focus is backend and thats it. I just wanted to connect
                    frontend made with React to Python 
                    backend with authorization functionality :)
